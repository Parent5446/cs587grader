Automatic Assignment Submission
===============================

CS-585 uses an automatic collection service. However, if you do not
follow instructions properly, your assignment may not be collected.

In order to make sure your assignment is ready to submit:

1. Sign into the application with your BitBucket account.
2. Select the correct repository on your user profile (this can be accessed
   by clicking on your username in navigation bar).
3. Make a git tag with the same name as the assignment.

Once these steps are complete, the application will automatically download
the git tag you made for the repository you selected.

Manual Assignment Submission
============================

If you created your account using the registration form, then you will have
to submit manually using the "Manual Submit" button on the homepage.

Make sure the file you upload is a .tar.gz file, otherwise it will not extract
and you will get a zero.

Grading Guidelines
==================

You will get a zero if:
1. The repository you specified is missing or deleted.
2. There is no git tag for the assignment name.
3. The git tag for the assignment was created after the due date (in other words,
   a late submission).
4. Your assignment does not have a Makefile.
5. Your assignment does not compile with "-Wall -Werror".

Note: These are only the automatic grading guidelines. Professor Grapsas has
other ways to get a zero (or a partial reduction).
